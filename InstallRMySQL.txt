We cannot intall RMySQL package directly through R like other packages on windows.

In order to install RMySQL, we need to install Rtools and MySQL server.
After the installation of MySQL server, find the file "libmysql.dll" in the program
file folder and copy it to the bin foler in the MySQL server folder.

Then we need to set up environment varible for MySQL.

Finally, run install.packages("RMySQL", type = "source") and we should be able to
install the RMySQL package on windows.

But this method does not work on Rstudio, and you should use it on R directly!
